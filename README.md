# Bike sharing is caring

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

Citibike has tasked us with identifying and presenting data pulled from their network of bicycles to find the best way to optimize their resources and optimize their maintenance based on these determinations.  The data has been broken down on timescale, geographic and gender based level to provide actionable insights.

## Results:

We have presented the data using a variety of visual outputs in order to create greater insight for the customer:

  - Checkout times for users to determine the average and peak ridership based on a 24 hour clock.
    - The peak usage being a duration of 5 minutes for 146,752 bikes and the majority of bike ride durations being under 20 minutes

  - Checkout times categorized by gender to determine if there are any trends that could be used for gender based marketing.
    - The vast majority of riders are male, and people who didnt define their gender being the lowest.

  - Trips by Weekday/ Hours to identify what days of the week and times of the day have to most demand, presented as a heatmap.
    - The areas that display the highest rider volume are between 0600-0900 and 1600-1900, indicative of commuter traffic which also provides                                           us with insight into the predominant use case for the bike rentals.

  - Trips by Weekday/ Hours based on gender to determine if there are any trends that could be used for gender based marketing.
    - The volume of male riders is highest, following the same ridership use patterns

  - User trip by gender, broken down into the days of the week. 
    - Males dominant this category with Thursdays being the busiest day of the week with subscribers.  Single use customers have an over all lower ridership and there are is not       significant variance between genders.

## Additional visualizations 
  - Data is very powerful and understanding the needs of the end user can help us select visualizations that are clear and effective.
    -  Ride duration displayed in 2 formats to help identify which visualization is better to present to interested parties

  - Location Data for start and end locations

## Summary:

  Citibike has taken developed a very useful system to enable users to travel in a fun and environmentally conscientious way.  The data we gathered provides helpful insight into the time of day and length of commutes.  Peak demand aligns with typical weekday commutes and the duration of rides are typically between 5 and 20 minutes long.  Mapping out the location of parking lots and public transit hubs and comparing the start and end points could identify improved locations to place bikes to ensure demand is being met during peak hours.  Also obtaining service data could help improve new batches of bikes by identifying weak points in the design and serve to extend ridability prior to service.
